Welcome to SnapWalk, the new amazing social app where users can share their favourite routes and can experience other's routes. Create or choose a route and play it. Look at your next location on the map and take a picture to check you're there and go to the next location. Once you're finished, comment and like the route, win points, and look at the ranking.
